Advanced Python Review Exercise 1
=================================
Ask the user for a number 'n' (check it is a numeric integer)
Print the square roots of the numbers from 1 to n using map
(You could just print each one, or populate a collection with all the resulting values)
Optionally, do the same using list comprehension

Implement a function which takes a single parameter and reports if it is a square number 
(i.e. return True or False)
Use this as a filter function to take the numbers -100 to 100 inclusive
and return only those values which are NOT square numbers
(Again, consider using a collection for the resulting values)

Import the 'show_args' method from this morning and use it to decorate each method

Optional
--------
Write your own decorator method which takes a function as an input 
and nicely displays some intrinsics of that function

In a separate module write a class which incorporates the functions you wrote above
Instances of the class should take min/max values (with sensible defaults)
The class methods should then apply map, filter or reduce to this range (min/max) and return nicely formatted results

Override the __str__ method so a class instance prints nicely

Write an abstract base class which encapsulates properties for 'min' and 'max' and also at least on method. Architect your class so it inherits from this abstract base class
